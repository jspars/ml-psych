Once received, I will reach out to schedule 
		an initial consultation if I am currently accepting new clients.</p> <p class="prose mx-auto">The initial consultation is a 20 to 30 minute, virtual, no cost, 
		consultation to get know you, what is bringing you to therapy, and to 
		assess whether we are a good fit to work together. I will ask you some
		questions, tell you more about my therapeutic approach, and you will 
		have time to ask me questions as well.</p> <p class="prose mx-auto">The working relationship between therapist and client is vital to the 
		success of therapy, and therapy is a significant investment of time and 
		resources, so finding a therapist with whom you feel a good rapport is
		important.</p> <h2 class="text-xl prose mx-auto">Do you accept insurance?</h2> <p class="prose mx-auto">I currently work with a third party platform to bill insurance. If we 
		agree to work together, and you wish to use insurance, we will discuss 
		this platform and billing during our initial consultation. I currently 
		can accept Anthem/BCBS and Aetna for Virginia residents only. For more 
		information, see the <a href="${l}/fees_and_insurance">fees and insurance</a> 
		page.</p> <h2 class="text-xl prose mx-auto">Can I use insurance for couples or relationship therapy?</h2> <p class="prose mx-auto">Unfortunately, probably not. Many health insurance policies do not 
		cover relationship, couples, or marital therapy, as couples therapy is 
		not specifically focused on treating a mental health disorder. Couples
		therapy is focused on helping individuals improve their romantic 
		relationships. This is not considered a medically necessary service by 
		most health insurance policies.</p> <h2 class="text-xl prose mx-auto">What is an intake?</h2> <p class="prose mx-auto">An intake is a first session, where I will gather background  
		information related to your reasons for seeking therapy, your 
		developmental history, and other information that helps me better 
		understand you and what is bringing you to therapy. Ideally, I prefer 
		90 minutes for the intake, to allow enough time to gather this 
		information.</p> <h2 class="text-xl prose mx-auto">How long do sessions last?</h2> <p class="prose mx-auto">Individual sessions typically last between 50 and 55 minutes and are 
		held weekly. We may meet less or more frequently if appropriate. We 
		will discuss frequency of sessions in our first session.</p> <p class="prose mx-auto">Couples sessions vary in length due to various factors. When possible, 
		I prefer to see couples for at least 75 minutes, once a week. If 
		schedules do not allow for a 75 minute session, we will meet for 50-55
		minutes.</p>`;return{c(){e=m("div"),e.innerHTML=p,this.h()},l(s){e=v(s,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),g(e)!=="svelte-2lihcx"&&(e.innerHTML=p),this.h()},h(){y(e,"class","bg-[var(--dark)] p-5")},m(s,a){c(s,e,a)},p:d,i:d,o:d,d(s){s&&r(e)}}}class A extends I{constructor(e){super(),_(this,e,null,S,k,{})}}function E(f){let e,p=`<div class="home-hero pt-10 svelte-10vm5a1"><div class="text-[var(--primary)] px-5 rounded home-head svelte-10vm5a1"><h1 class="pb-3 text-4xl sm:text-6xl">Lawson Psychotherapy</h1> <h2 class="pb-3 font-light text-xl sm:text-4xl">Making sense together</h2> <div class="svelte-10vm5a1"><a href="${l}/contact" class="btn btn-warning my-2">Get in touch</a> <a href="${l}/about" class="btn btn-secondary my-2">Learn more</a></div></div> <img src="${l}/images/hero.jpg" width="800" class="blur-sm lg:blur-none svelte-10vm5a1" alt="a welcoming space to straighten out your thoughts"/></div>`,s,a,x=`<div class="pb-5"><div class="container p-5"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-4"><div class="service-card drop-shadow-lg bg-[#f2d7ba]/50  svelte-10vm5a1"><img src="${l}/images/couples0.png" alt=""/> <h3 class="text-2xl mt-3 svelte-10vm5a1">Couples</h3> <p class="svelte-10vm5a1">Together, we&#39;ll identify and break out of destructive communication cycles.</p></div></div> <div class="col-md-4"><div class="service-card drop-shadow-lg bg-[#f2d7ba]/50 svelte-10vm5a1"><img src="${l}/images/individual0.png" alt=""/> <h3 class="text-2xl mt-3 svelte-10vm5a1">Individual</h3> <p class="svelte-10vm5a1">I provide depth-oriented therapy for a diverse range of adults.</p></div></div> <div class="col-md-4"><div class="service-card drop-shadow-lg bg-[#f2d7ba]/50 svelte-10vm5a1"><img src="${l}/images/tele1.png" alt=""/> <h3 class="text-2xl mt-3 svelte-10vm5a1">Teletherapy</h3> <p class="svelte-10vm5a1">I&#39;m PSYPACT Authorized to practice teletherapy across certain state lines.</p></div></div></div> <div class="row"></div></div></div>`,h,i,n,u;return n=new A({}),{c(){e=m("section"),e.innerHTML=p,s=w(),a=m("section"),a.innerHTML=x,h=w(),i=m("section"),$(n.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(t){e=v(t,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),g(e)!=="svelte-4oi80p"&&(e.innerHTML=p),s=b(t),a=v(t,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),g(a)!=="svelte-1vw97wt"&&(a.innerHTML=x),h=b(t),i=v(t,"SECTION",{class:!0});var o=T(i);C(n.$$.fragment,o),o.forEach(r),this.h()},h(){y(e,"class","hero-section bg-[var(--dark)] p-2 sm:p-5"),y(i,"class","")},m(t,o){c(t,e,o),c(t,s,o),c(t,a,o),c(t,h,o),c(t,i,o),q(n,i,null),u=!0},p:d,i(t){u||(H(n.$$.fragment,t),u=!0)},o(t){L(n.$$.fragment,t),u=!1},d(t){t&&(r(e),r(s),r(a),r(h),r(i)),M(n)}}}class F extends I{constructor(e){super(),_(this,e,null,E,k,{})}}export{F as component};
